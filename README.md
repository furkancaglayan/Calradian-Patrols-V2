## Changelog
> #### v.4.0.1:
- Fixed a crash that happens when creating a custom game.

## Features

- Patrol parties have their own lifecycle. They go out to hunt, and if they run low on food or have many prisoners, they'll go back to their town to replenish. Once they got into their towns, they will buy food, gather units if they are low on numbers, and sell prisoners. 
- Patrol parties have their own AI. They will try to protect the attacked villagers, caravans, and other patrol parties.
- Ai settlements may create patrol parties daily.
- Dialogues with patrol parties.
- Auto recruitment for patrol parties. 
- Towns can have up to 9 patrol parties, depending on the owner clan's tier. To hire a party, the player must have enough renown and gold. The gold cost of the party depends on settlement security, loyalty, and existing patrol parties that are bound to the town(Cost increases with each party). When a party is hired, it will take nearly a day in order the party to prepare.
- Each patrol party provides a small bonus to town security.
- Patrol parties may report their encounters through dialogues.
- Bandit density is increased to have an even game.
- Disbanding town patrols is also possible.
- Compatible with [MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/612).
